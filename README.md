Here's a short explanation about my project and video on the comparison of the performance and behavior of the Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms based on the simulation results of the AI based tic-tac-toe game:

1.Minimax Algorithm explores all possible game states to make optimal decisions, but it is slower because it checks every branch without skipping any.

2.Alpha-Beta Pruning significantly improves performance by eliminating branches that cannot affect the final decision, reducing unnecessary computation.

3.In both simulations, the AI (playing as 'X') never loses and plays optimally.

4.The output board states and winners are the same in both approaches, proving that Alpha-Beta Pruning doesn't affect the resultâ€”just the efficiency.

5.Execution time for Alpha-Beta Pruning is noticeably lower compared to Minimax, making it more suitable for real-time applications or larger games.
